    <strong>Experience & Hobby</strong>
    <p>I grew up in a small coastal city in China.Through hard work and determination, I was able to enter one of the top universities in my province. After studying there for two years, I decided to continue my academic journey in Japan, and moved here in 2024 to study Information Science.

<p></p>One of my main interests is playing tennis. I started during Primary school and have played continuously since then. Tennis helps me stay fit, focused, and mentally refreshed—especially when balancing studies and daily life in a foreign environment. I usually play singles and doubles matches with classmates on weekends, and it’s a wonderful way to make friends and unwind.

<p></p>I also enjoy creating things on the computer. Building web pages gives me a sense of achievement—seeing a blank screen turn into something interactive and meaningful is very satisfying. Through class projects, I’ve learned how to design layouts and bring ideas to life using code.

<p></p>Studying in Japan has taught me independence, flexibility, and open-mindedness. I look forward to exploring more of Japanese culture, improving my language abilities, and taking on new tech challenges.
